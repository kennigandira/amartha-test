   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or if you're using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement (HMR) |
| `npm run build`   | Creates an optimized production build in the `/dist` folder          |
| `npm run lint`    | Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues                         |
| `npm run preview` | Previews the production build locally                                |

## Development Guide

### Path Aliases

The project uses path aliases for cleaner imports:

```typescript
// Instead of: import Button from '../../../components/Button'
import Button from "@/components/Button";
```

The `@` symbol maps to the `/src` directory.

### Routing

This project uses **TanStack Router** with file-based routing:

- Routes are defined in the `src/routes/` directory
- `__root.tsx` is the root layout component
- Each file in `routes/` automatically becomes a route
- The route tree is auto-generated in `routeTree.gen.ts`

**Available Routes:**

- `/` - Home page (team listing)
- `/wizard` - Employee wizard

### Styling

The project uses **Tailwind CSS v4** with the Vite plugin:

- Utility-first CSS framework
- Dark mode support via `next-themes`
- Component variants managed with `class-variance-authority`
- Use the `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` to merge Tailwind classes

Example:

```typescript
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

<div className={cn('base-class', condition && 'conditional-class')} />
```

## Configuration Files

### vite.config.js

- Configures TanStack Router plugin with auto code-splitting
- Sets up path aliases (`@` â†’ `/src`)
- Integrates Tailwind CSS Vite plugin

### tsconfig.json

- TypeScript compiler options
- Path aliases configuration
- Module resolution strategy

### eslint.config.js

- React-specific linting rules
- React Hooks rules
- Custom rules for unused variables

### .prettierrc

- Code formatting configuration (uses Prettier defaults)

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized files will be in the `/dist` directory. To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Code Quality

The project includes:

- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **TypeScript** for type safety

Run linting before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style and formatting
2. Run `npm run lint` before committing
3. Ensure TypeScript types are properly defined
4. Test your changes in both light and dark modes
